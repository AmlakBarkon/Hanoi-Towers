Project: HANOI TOWER


5 stories:
	As the user, I must be able to move discs from one tower to the next.
	As the developer, I should make the site look clean and not cluttered.
	As the user, I should be able to navigate the site/game with ease.
	As the developer, There needs to be an end to the game.
	As the user, I should be able clearly understand the rules of the game.
	(was a little confused with what exactly Iâ€™m supposed to say)
